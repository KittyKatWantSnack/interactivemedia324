  		<p><b>Swaggyspaceman:</b> <mark> My parents just don't take me seriously about it. Every time I try to tell them about this problem they roll their eyes/accuse me of being melodramatic.</mark></p>

  		<p><b>Kathleen:</b> My trigger is whistling. I've worked in several offices that have open floor plans (no walls or cubicles) with habitual whistlers. <mark>I've tried speaking to my bosses. They roll their eyes. I've approached the whistlers. In one case, he increased whistling more often to mock me. An ex-boyfriend was infuriated with me because he said whistling is an expression of joy.</mark></p>

  		<p><b>Adrian:</b> I'm 12 years old and as I've stated in other threads I'm triggered by eating noises. my mom's a very loud eater and I have to quite literally destroy my hearing with loud music to not hear the noises. I've left the room but I can still hear her. I hate it. <mark>I've tried asking her to stop but she doesn't take misophonia seriously.</mark> Every time i hear it I have horrible, violent thoughts about the person making the sound. if I continue doing what I'm currently doing I'll end up going deaf. what can I do?</p>

  		<p><b>{deleted}:</b> <mark> I once politely asked my dad to stop eating his frozen cherries so loudly. He leaned over right next to my ear and sucked his fingers one by one.</mark> When I scooted to the other end of the sofa, <mark>he became so offended he tried to make me go to my room.</mark> I was 26, by the way, and he was 49.</p>

  		<p><b>Claire:</b><mark> My parents have started to understand misophonia, but that doesn't stop them from getting their feelings hurt.</mark> I can't help the way I react to the way they eat and it takes all my willpower to not mention anything. I'm one of those people with a ridiculously expressive face so they can usually end up reading my emotions and seeing that I'm fighting rage. I just can't figure out why people have to smack their food and why no one else notices!! I can't even eat at the dinner table without music. This whole thing is hard enough for me and I already feel like I'm being stupid and overdramatic, and <mark>when they either (a) roll their eyes or (b) get offended, it makes it that much harder. Lately, they just get upset and I'm not sure what to do. I'm tired of hurting my parents like this.</mark></p>

  		<p><b>Eddie Lally:</b> <mark>I'm having great difficulty in conveying how serious my misophonia is to everyone. It doesnt help that im 16 so most of the people that i have to tell to stop are immature, thus prompting them torture me.</mark> (Torture is a strong word; being the reason that i used it). <mark>For some reason this is almost always the case when i tell someone to stop triggering me. </mark>Sometimes i feel like i have to seriously harm them to stop it from happening, luckily i have not seriously injured anyone yet but im terrified that i will one day. I have punched few people in the face but im very against any kind of violence and hate myself so much for it.</p>

  		<p><b>Sundaygirl:</b> <mark>I just asked colleagues to please not chew gum in my presence and they were completely unsympathetic insisting that I wouldn't hear it even though I said I DO hear it, but they countered to it is an unreasonable request.</mark> People are mean.</p>
      <img src="line2.png" class="line">
  		<p><b>S.W.:</b> I have misophonia (hate certain sounds) and misokinesia (hate certain movements) and <mark>people don't believe I have it. They can't tell what is going on in my mind!</mark></p>
      <img src="line2.png" class="line">
  		<p><b>{deleted}:</b> I don't understand why <mark>my friends won't get this no matter how much I stress it. I opened up about my misophonia, and in return, they decided to do a stupid prank on me by purposely trying to trigger it.</mark> At first I tried to cover my ears but then I ran into the nearest room and locked myself in. I was literally ripping out hair and clawing at my skin, crying in tears on the floor. <mark>Only then did they realize that this is a freaking serious condition and not some silly 'omg I hate that noise lol'. I'm so angry right now. I hate when people do this crap.</mark></p>

  		<p><b>Meghalomaniaac:</b> I have a relatively new boyfriend and only recently explained the severity of misophonia. The other night we were having a tickle fight and he was holding me down and I said something like 'you'll have to let go of me sometime' and <mark>he said 'I'll just (trigger noise)'. I stopped, the smiling stopped, the fun stopped. I said 'never ever say that again.' He immediately apologized and said he never would, but people without it just don't understand. If they love you they should believe you, though. It's heart-breaking when they don't.</mark></p>

  		<p><b>Handbanana42:</b><mark> My mom still thinks I don't eat dinner with family because my dad left us, even though I've told her about 20 times I have misophonia.</mark> Recently saw my 10 year old niece scream and run away when someone scraped their fork on a plate. I feel so bad that she will probably have to deal with the same problems. I should talk to her.</p>
