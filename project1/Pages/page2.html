  		<p><b>Sadie_marie:</b> Yes! My grandma'a voice. It's very loud, naggy, and sharp. <mark>I grind my teeth and dig my nails into whatever is close by when I hear it.</mark> I feel so terrible for feeling that way cause I love her.</p>

  		<p><b>Fisker:</b> Sound of basketball bouncing... neighbours son is playing and the sound <mark>makes me feel so much rage inside..</mark> I consider moving to another place.</p>

  		<p><b>Adrian:</b> Slurping, chewing (especially open mouth chewing), lip smacking, certain foods being stirred (like macaroni, stew, etc.) Lip smacking is my major trigger. <mark>i sometimes get violent when my brother triggers my misophonia (he does it on purpose a lot). i twitch and before i know it i'm getting yelled at for smacking him upside the head.</mark></p>

  		<p><b>Lucy:</b> My parents are big believers in family dinners so <mark>i cant avoid it</mark> and both my dad and my sister eat really loudly and whenever i ask them to be quiet and try to explain to them they just say 'i cant help it' and they dont understand and <mark>sometimes i feel like exploding and ripping out my hair.</mark> What do i do?</p>

  		<p><b>Eddie Lally:</b> Im having great difficulty in conveying how serious my misophonia is to everyone. It doesnt help that im 16 so most of the people that i have to tell to stop are immature, thus prompting them torture me. (Torture is a strong word; being the reason that i used it). For some reason this is almost always the case when i tell someone to stop triggering me. <mark>Sometimes i feel like i have to seriously harm them to stop it from happening, luckily i have not seriously injured anyone yet but im terrified that i will one day. I have punched few people in the face but im very against any kind of violence and hate myself so much for it.</mark></p>

  		<p><b>Anon:</b> I am only twelve and the sound of sniffling in class <mark>makes me so disgusted and angry, I can't even explain it, that I began to scratch at my wrists with a pencil to distract me.</mark> My teacher noticed though and I was sent to the counsellor and although it helped talking to someone about it who didn't think I was annoying or crazy, <mark>it still drives me absolutely mad.</mark> Yawning is probably the worst trigger for me and <mark>sometimes I physically lash out or simply burst into tears whenever I hear it.</mark></p>

  		<p><b>Hannah:</b> I'm seated next to a colleague who eats with her mouth open and makes awful sloppy noises, slurp her drinks and burps. She yawns really loudly almost constantly too. The problem is she is constantly eating ... I think she lacks social awareness. <mark>Anyway it's making me really miserable. I feel such awful anger when it happens, my chest hurts and I feel nauseous. I really have to hold myself back from lashing out.</mark> I have to walk out whenever she comes in as I just can't cope! I dread work now and <mark>it's making me depressed.</mark> I'm sure my colleagues have noticed and I'm worried they think I'm being rude or nasty.</p>

  		<p><b>Gem:</b> I am a long term misophonia sufferer and have experienced frustration and rage mostly with eating sounds before. However recently <mark>I have developed a pure rage response</mark> to my housemate's constant throat clearing and breathing. She holds her breath slightly before exhale so it sounds like a quiet grunt. She clears her throat about every 30 seconds and <mark>it engrages me to the point of feeling sick and having tears in my eyes.</mark> Eating and loud finger sucking during meals is also a problem. I am going through a breakup so my tolerance and capacity for emotional responses is at an all time low. I have stopped interacting with her and will just sit in my room with my rain app blaring in my ears for hours just to feel calm in my home.</p>

		<p><b>Handbanana42:</b> My mom still thinks I don't eat dinner with family because my dad left us, even though I've told her about 20 times I have misophonia. Recently saw my 10 year old niece <mark>scream and run away</mark> when someone scraped their fork on a plate. I feel so bad that she will probably have to deal with the same problems. I should talk to her.</p>

  		<p><b>Alyssa McCracken:</b> I've had this problem for as long as I can remember (I'm 19) and it's really bad. When my family eats dinner I have to have my headphones on and at full volume just to help me ignore the fact that someone is eating... <mark>I remember times just looking at my mom or brother and just thinking terrible things simply because I could hear them chewing. Sometimes I literally wanna rip my ears off.</mark> It's a big problem in my life and I feel so bad about.</p>
      <img src="line2.png" class="line">
  		<p><b>Julie W.:</b> I don't know if anyone else has a problem with certain people's voices but I sure do. <mark>I absolutely can't stand my co-worker's voice and I have a very visceral reaction to it. I was almost having panic attacks at work whenever I'd hear her and naturally she talks all day long.</mark> I started keeping my door shut but I could still hear her through the wall. I invested $20 in a white noise machine and I set it on ocean sounds. I keep the volume fairly high and it drowns her out about 90%. I know everyone around me thinks I'm being antisocial with my door shut all day, but trust me, <mark>it's keeping me from killing someone.</mark></p>

  		<p><b>Gabriella:</b> My most severe trigger sound is the sound of people chewing and one of my family members barely closes their mouth when they chew. <mark>Whenever I hear it my body becomes inflamed, it gets hard to breathe, and tears form in my eyes,</mark> but I can't leave the room because my parents think I'm faking it!</p>
      <img src="line2.png" class="line">
  		<p><b>Jon:</b> So, the sound of ANYONE eating (especially someone who smacks their lips while eating) <mark>drives me NUCKING FUTS!!!!!</mark> It is so bad that in the past <mark>I have had to get up from Christmas dinner with the family & go into another room so as not to hurt someone.</mark> The only thing that helps me is to have music (best solution) or some other background noise going on to focus on. I don't have any problems in a loud environment, but dear God don't let someone be eating loudly around me if it is quiet!!!</p>

  		<p><b>Adrian:</b> I'm 12 years old and as I've stated in other threads I'm triggered by eating noises. my mom's a very loud eater and I have to quite literally destroy my hearing with loud music to not hear the noises. I've left the room but I can still hear her. I hate it. I've tried asking her to stop but she doesn't take misophonia seriously. <mark>Every time i hear it I have horrible, violent thoughts about the person making the sound.</mark> if I continue doing what I'm currently doing I'll end up going deaf. what can I do?</p>

  		<p><b>Laura:</b> It may sound ridiculous but my idea of hell is being trapped in a room with my mother whilst she eats a juicy pear. This is a very specific and vivid memory I have as a child. Now <mark>my reaction to friends and family is to quite often verbally degrade and humiliate them over the fact they are making noises which I find horrifying. If I can't verbally shout out my disgust I have to physically restrain myself.</mark> And I feel horrible for it.</p>
