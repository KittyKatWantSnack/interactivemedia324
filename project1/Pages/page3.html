  	<p><b>Alyssa McCracken:</b> I've had this problem for as long as I can remember (I'm 19) and it's really bad. When my family eats dinner <mark>I have to have my headphones on and at full volume just to help me ignore the fact that someone is eating...</mark> I remember times just looking at my mom or brother and just thinking terrible things simply because I could hear them chewing. Sometimes I literally wanna rip my ears off. It's a big problem in my life and I feel so bad about. </p>

  	<p><b>Kat:</b> <mark>I actually find that taking a deep breath and trying to focus on my own breathing helps. I also try to bear in mind that they're not doing it on purpose to annoy me (although it feels that way!)</mark></p>

  	<p><b>Anne-Fleur:</b> One of my triggers is people whispering. If i hear that, i have to hold myself back from doing any violence. But I think I've found something that helps. <mark>I sort of sing a song in my head and concentrate fully on that song.</mark> That helps me to not concentrating on the whispering anymore.</p>

  	<p><b>Emma:</b> People shaking their legs, blinking, unusual mouth movements are all triggers for me. <mark>Mimicking is almost a necessity when I see these things, I spend my life with my head in the corner of rooms or with my hair/hands blocking my peripheral vision. Having to blind and deafen yourself with earphones and white noise 24/7 is driving me crazy.</mark> It's very isolating.</p>

  	<p><b>Julie W.:</b> I don't know if anyone else has a problem with certain people's voices but I sure do. I absolutely can't stand my co-worker's voice and I have a very visceral reaction to it. I was almost having panic attacks at work whenever I'd hear her and naturally she talks all day long. <mark>I started keeping my door shut but I could still hear her through the wall. I invested $20 in a white noise machine and I set it on ocean sounds. I keep the volume fairly high and it drowns her out about 90%. I know everyone around me thinks I'm being antisocial with my door shut all day,</mark> but trust me, it's keeping me from killing someone.</p>

  	<p><b>Jon:</b> So, the sound of ANYONE eating (especially someone who smacks their lips while eating) drives me NUCKING FUTS!!!!! It is so bad that in the past I have had to get up from Christmas dinner with the family & go into another room so as not to hurt someone. <mark>The only thing that helps me is to have music (best solution) or some other background noise going on to focus on.</mark> I don't have any problems in a loud environment, but dear God don't let someone be eating loudly around me if it is quiet!!!</p>

  	<p><b>Adrian:</b> I'm 12 years old and as I've stated in other threads I'm triggered by eating noises. my mom's a very loud eater and <mark>I have to quite literally destroy my hearing with loud music to not hear the noises. I've left the room but I can still hear her.</mark> I hate it. I've tried asking her to stop but she doesn't take misophonia seriously. Every time i hear it I have horrible, violent thoughts about the person making the sound. if I continue doing what I'm currently doing I'll end up going deaf. what can I do?</p>

  	<p><b>Jo:</b> I have had this condition for 40 years. <mark>I tolerate eating with people better if I eat in our kitchen with the cooker hood fan on. White noise seems to keep me calmer. I prefer to eat out in busy restaurants as the background noise also distracts my attention from noise at the dinner table. Trips to the cinema are rare but I sit on the back row with my own popcorn. This way no one is annoying behind me and I can eat popcorn to distract me from other noise in front of me.<mark></p>

  	<p><b>Molly:</b> I heavily searched for noise cancelling headphones before I came to the conclusion that <mark>construction headphones were the best option for me.</mark> If I come into a scenario where I hear my trigger sound, babies crying, and I know I can't get out I feel embarrassed because I know it looks silly but <mark>I put on the huge headphones.</mark> I honestly wish there was something more discreet that wouldn't be so obvious.</p>

  	<p><b>Remora80:</b> Goodbye family dinners. After 30 years of family life, I give up. They know I don't like, I can't stand their lack of manners. Their loud chewing, always with an open mouth. Their lip smacking. Their grunts. Their satisfied sighs after they drink. And yet they never tried to correct that. I have to take care of my mental health. I give up. <mark>I am not having meals with my family anymore. I am alone in the guest room as they are all together and eat loud and laugh. I will have a sandwich outside.</mark> FML.</p>

  	<p><b>Crimsonandhearts:</b> <mark>I haven't eaten dinner with my family for a decade because of the way my father eats.</mark> It's just better for me. I can't stand it.</p>
