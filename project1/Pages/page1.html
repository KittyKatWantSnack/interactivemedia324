    <p><b>Kat:</b> I find it infuriating <mark>when people bite their fork or scrape the fork on their teeth when they're eating!</mark></p>
    <img src="line2.png" class="line">
    <p><b>Laura:</b> It may sound ridiculous but <mark>my idea of hell is being trapped in a room with my mother whilst she eats a juicy pear.</mark> This is a very specific and vivid memory I have as a child. Now my reaction to friends and family is to quite often verbally degrade and humiliate them over the fact they are making noises which I find horrifying. If I can't verbally shout out my disgust I have to physically restrain myself. And I feel horrible for it.</p>

    <p><b>Fisker:</b> <mark>Sound of basketball bouncing.</mark> Neighbor's son is playing and the sound makes me feel so much rage inside... I consider moving to another place. </p>
    <img src="line2.png" class="line">
    <p><b>Meg:</b> <mark>I cannot stand it when people eat. It's gotten to the point where I can't eat with my family most days because the sounds of them chomping on their food and rubbing their forks against their plates/teeth makes me cringe. Also, I get very annoyed when people chew gum and I constantly hear them smacking it; even if their mouths are closed. The cracking of bones, clicking of pens, and sounds of people itching themselves also tend to set me off.</mark> Basically, any sound I get annoyed with is insane!!!</p>
    <img src="line2.png" class="line">
    <p><b>Trish:</b> <mark>The sounds people make when they scrape forks or spoons on dishes while eating.
	Loud breathing makes me want to punch someone</mark> ugh. I will first ask if their nose is stuffed up before wanting to punch them 
	<mark>Pets cleaning themselves...</mark> I lose it and either kick them out of the room or leave the room myself totally ticked off!
	</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Adrian:</b> <mark>Slurping, chewing (especially open mouth chewing), lip smacking, certain foods being stirred (like macaroni, stew, etc.) Lip smacking is my major trigger.</mark> I sometimes get violent when my brother triggers my misophonia (he does it on purpose a lot). I twitch and before I know it I'm getting yelled at for smacking him upside the head. </p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Rhino118:</b> <mark>People breathing</mark> hurts me.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">v
	<p><b>Taz:</b> <mark>Juicy fruits as above, anything crunchy, especially crisps, certain people's style of typing on computer keyboards, some computer mouses, especially if they are used directly on a desk without a mat, all plastic wrapping, creaky chairs, barking dogs, nail clippers, mobile phone keypad tones, some mobile phone text alerts, ineffective, repetitive throat clearing, page turning, sometimes, blister packs of tablets, cutlery on crockery, cutlery on plastic, cutlery on teeth!</mark></p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Taylor Marie:</b> <mark>Mine is the sound of a lot of talking at once, loud tv's, or loud music, the sound of arguing, two or more people screaming, whining!</mark> </p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Zed:</b> <mark>Crisps being chewed, chewing gum, Wet mouth sounds, General eating noises, whistling through teeth, heavy breathing close to me, tapping, typing, high heels on hard floors, gulping, rustling of paper/plastic bags etc and all other irregular sounds that canâ€™t be anticipated or don't have a pattern. Oh, and my Dog licking her nose.</mark>AAAAggghhhhhhh!!</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Kathy:</b> <mark>Basketballs dribbling for hours on end.</mark> I cannot stand it, and I live next door to a constant game. It is affecting my health.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Kathleen:</b> <mark>My trigger is whistling.</mark> I've worked in several offices that have open floor plans (no walls or cubicles) with habitual whistlers. I've tried speaking to my bosses. They roll their eyes. I've approached the whistlers. In one case, he increased whistling more often to mock me. An ex-boyfriend was infuriated with me because he said whistling is an expression of joy.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Watkykjypoes:</b> <mark>WHISTLING.</mark> Cannot stand it. I feel like such a dick because whistling is associated with happy/joyful feelings but it does nothing but fill me with rage.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Liz:</b> My main triggers are: <mark>people talking with food in their mouth, sniffing/sneezing, Coughing, noisy eating, pen clicking, babies/children crying/noisy.</mark> I find the work environment particularly difficult as I simply can't avoid these noises and it really can lead to me feeling trapped, my stomach is in a knot and I feel like I could cry and just go home.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Honey:</b> Everything is a trigger or at least that's how it feels: <mark>Dogs barking, Kids talking loud, Baby crying. People eating especially with their mouth open,</mark> I have to leave the room some times. <mark>Biting nails, even people just touching their nails I swear I can hear noise! Chewing yogurt... not necessarily! Clanking cutlery around the mouth.</mark> Pretty much anything that some deem upsetting you can add it on the list! Makes meal times especially very uncomfortable for everyone!</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Truus:</b> My triggers have changed over the years but lately the one that's bothering me the most is sick noises. Like <mark>people who are sick coughing violently, hacking up phlegm, sniffling, blowing their nose in a honking way, etc.</mark> The sounds of their sickness in certain environments gets me so angry inside, like I'm being personally offended or something, even though I know they can't help it!! I feel so bad.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Nm_0419:</b> Fuck <mark>people who eat chips in libraries.</mark> That is all.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>12 yr old girl:</b> Anybody sounds. The ones in caps are the BIG ones < <mark>COUGHING, BURPING, FARTING, CLEARING THROAT, SNIFFLING, SNEEZING, SLURPING, SLURPING.</mark> Some other mild ones < <mark>Gum chewing, forms of talking, shushing, scratching, scraping.</mark> Now.... This is something also weird about my Misophonia. For me, it's mostly ONLY human sounds. Sounds like animals, traffic, train, etc are fine for me. In fact, when my dog Gia farts or sneezes, my reaction is.....Awwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Anon:</b> I am only twelve and the <mark>sound of sniffling in class</mark> makes me so disgusted and angry, I can't even explain it, that I began to scratch at my wrists with a pencil to distract me. My teacher noticed though and I was sent to the counsellor and although it helped talking to someone about it who didn't think I was annoying or crazy, it still drives me absolutely mad. <mark>Yawning is probably the worst trigger for me</mark> and sometimes I physically lash out or simply burst into tears whenever I hear it.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Hannah:</b> I'm seated next to a colleague who <mark>eats with her mouth open and makes awful sloppy noises, slurp her drinks and burps. She yawns really loudly almost constantly too.</mark> The problem is she is constantly eating ... I think she lacks social awareness. Anyway, it's making me really miserable. I feel such awful anger when it happens, my chest hurts and I feel nauseous. I really have to hold myself back from lashing out. I have to walk out whenever she comes in as I just can't cope! I dread work now and it's making me depressed. I'm sure my colleagues have noticed and I'm worried they think I'm being rude or nasty.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Red-Lantern:</b> <mark>People scratching themselves.</mark> Hair and beards especially. Seeing the flakes of dandruff and dead skin fall is horrible and I have to gtfo.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Gem:</b> I am a long term misophonia sufferer and have experienced frustration and rage mostly with eating sounds before. However recently I have developed a pure rage response to <mark>my housemate's constant throat clearing and breathing.</mark> She holds her breath slightly before exhale so it sounds like a quiet grunt. She clears her throat about every 30 seconds and it enrages me to the point of feeling sick and having tears in my eyes. <mark>Eating and loud finger sucking during meals is also a problem.</mark> I am going through a breakup so my tolerance and capacity for emotional responses is at an all-time low. I have stopped interacting with her and will just sit in my room with my rain app blaring in my ears for hours just to feel calm in my home.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Hannah:</b> I'm 21 and for as long as I can remember <mark>I haven't been able to stand tapping noises</mark> (get quite angry and frustrated when somebody won't stop) <mark>swallowing drink, eating sounds</mark> and I find myself eating more when I'm already full to help mask any sounds from others eating or drinking, leaving the room and making excuses to go anywhere but the room I'm in.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Rohit Sharan:</b> I have a weird problem... <mark>My ears have become sensitive to words that sound with 'S'.</mark> When people speak to me and some word that starts with 'S' comes up my ears feel irritated. I have to also mention that due to loud sound exposure i have got a very mild form of tinnitus for the past 2 to 3 months... But this 's' sound problem has recently occurred. What can i do to stop it?</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Emma:</b> <mark>People shaking their legs, blinking, unusual mouth movements are all triggers for me.</mark> Mimicking is almost a necessity when I see these things, I spend my life with my head in the corner of rooms or with my hair/hands blocking my peripheral vision. Having to blind and deafen yourself with earphones and white noise 24/7 is driving me crazy. It's very isolating.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Julie W.:</b> I don't know if anyone else has a problem with <mark>certain people's voices</mark> but I sure do. <mark>I absolutely can't stand my co-worker's voice</mark> and I have a very visceral reaction to it. I was almost having panic attacks at work whenever I'd hear her and naturally she talks all day long. I started keeping my door shut but I could still hear her through the wall. I invested $20 in a white noise machine and I set it on ocean sounds. I keep the volume fairly high and it drowns her out about 90%. I know everyone around me thinks I'm being antisocial with my door shut all day, but trust me, it's keeping me from killing someone.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Gabriella:</b> My most severe trigger sound is the <mark>sound of people chewing</mark> and one of my family members barely closes their mouth when they chew. Whenever I hear it my body becomes inflamed, it gets hard to breathe, and tears form in my eyes, but I can't leave the room because my parents think I'm faking it!</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Sadie_marie:</b> Yes! <mark>My grandma'a voice.</mark> It's very loud, naggy, and sharp. I grind my teeth and dig my nails into whatever is close by when I hear it. I feel so terrible for feeling that way cause I love her.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Jon:</b> So, <mark>the sound of ANYONE eating<mark> (especially <mark>someone who smacks their lips while eating</mark>) drives me NUCKING FUTS!!!!! It is so bad that in the past I have had to get up from Christmas dinner with the family & go into another room so as not to hurt someone. The only thing that helps me is to have music (best solution) or some other background noise going on to focus on. I don't have any problems in a loud environment, but dear God don't let someone be eating loudly around me if it is quiet!!!</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Adrian:</b> I'm 12 years old and as I've stated in other threads <mark>I'm triggered by eating noises.</mark> my mom's a very loud eater and I have to quite literally destroy my hearing with loud music to not hear the noises. I've left the room but I can still hear her. I hate it. I've tried asking her to stop but she doesn't take misophonia seriously. Every time i hear it I have horrible, violent thoughts about the person making the sound. if I continue doing what I'm currently doing I'll end up going deaf. what can I do?</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Molly:</b> I heavily searched for noise cancelling headphones before I came to the conclusion that construction headphones were the best option for me. If I come into a scenario where I hear my trigger sound, <mark>babies crying</mark>, and I know I can't get out I feel embarrassed because I know it looks silly but I put on the huge headphones. I honestly wish there was something more discreet that wouldn't be so obvious.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Sadnesssetfree:</b> One of the most triggering sounds is <mark>that fucking subtle lip smack when people are eating/talking.</mark> It's not a full blown monster smack it's a quick little smack that happens when people are talking while eating when holy shit it's the most annoying thing ever.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Kambz22:</b> <mark>Gum</mark> serves no point. I hate it. This ass hole has been popping his gum once every minute. How am I the only one going un freaking sane?</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Remora80:</b> Goodbye family dinners. After 30 years of family life, I give up. They know I don't like, I can't stand their lack of manners. Their <mark>loud chewing, always with an open mouth. Their lip smacking. Their grunts. Their satisfied sighs after they drink.</mark> And yet they never tried to correct that. I have to take care of my mental health. I give up. I am not having meals with my family anymore. I am alone in the guest room as they are all together and eat loud and laugh. I will have a sandwich outside. FML.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>Biology_bunny:</b> <mark>People breathing.</mark> Makes for an awkward situation when you ask them to stop. <mark>Also dogs barking,</mark> when my neighbors small dog starts going off I want to just run the thing over.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">

	<p><b>NuConcept:</b> Lot of missing the point out there today with the obvious triggers... sadly I've got a trigger that makes me a monster. <mark>The sound of repetitive kissing...</mark> as in kisses to my children from my wife or mother. It should be noted that this is the one trigger sound creating act that I do not intentionally avoid making myself... in that I am saved from monsterhood..</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>SnakeShow:</b> Since I've woken up an hour ago I heard my stepmother <mark>clear her throat 169 times.</mark> I keep a tally. She says that she can't help it because she feels like she'll choke otherwise but honestly I am losing sleep and my sanity over this and I have been driven to tears many many times over her throat clearing and I wish I could just drive an ice pick through my ears so I never have to deal with this ever again.</p>
	<img src="line2.png" class="line">
	<p><b>ThisisZoness:</b> For me, it's <mark>the squeaking sound of sharpies or other similar markers being drug across a page repeatedly.</mark></p>
